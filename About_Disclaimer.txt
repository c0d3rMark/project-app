About this tool
---------------

One of the most exciting parts of travel planning is working out a shortlist of potential locations. If you're anything like me, this involves some research to narrow down some possibilities. One of the key factors for my travel planning is weather averages. I want to make sure the locations I have in mind meet the weather criteria I am looking for. The way I have done this previously, is to manually search each individual location and to sort through the data.

I found this approach to be time consuming and often limiting in the results. For instance, when you search for weather averages of potential travel locations, you are working from a list of holiday destinantions you've already decided on. This is not bad if you know where you'd like to go. On the other hand if you find yourself being more adventerous you can ask questions like: 

For me, the more interesting questions is 

Where should I travel in June with an average temperature of 20 degrees celsius?

As a result this tool came to fruition and allows you to start your holiday planning journey with a quick shortlist of travel possibilities. It can dramatically reduce the time to curate a list destinantions based on weather criteria. Also, provide exciting new travel ideas by showing locations you may have previously overlooked.

Happy travel planning : )
